## Introduction

ProseMirror provides a set of tools and concepts for building rich text editors, using a user interface inspired by what-you-see-is-what-you-get, but trying to avoid the pitfalls of that style of editing.

The main principle of ProseMirror is that your code gets full control over the document and what happens to it. This document isn't a blob of HTML, but a custom data structure that only contains elements that you explicitly allow it to contain, in relations that you specified. All updates go through a single point, where you can inspect them and react to them.

The core library is not an easy drop-in component—we are prioritizing modularity and customizability over simplicity, with the hope that, in the future, people will distribute drop-in editors based on ProseMirror. As such, this is more of a Lego set than a Matchbox car.

There are four essential modules, which are required to do any editing at all, and a number of extension modules maintained by the core team, which have a status similar to that of 3rd party modules—they provide useful functionality, but you may omit them or replace them with other modules that implement similar functionality.

The essential modules are:

- <ProseMirrorModel /> defines the editor's document model, the data structure
  used to describe the content of the editor.
- prosemirror-state provides the data structure that describes the editor's whole state, including the selection, and a transaction system for moving from one state to the next.
- prosemirror-view implements a user interface component that shows a given editor state as an editable element in the browser, and handles user interaction with that element.
- prosemirror-transform contains functionality for modifying documents in a way that can be recorded and replayed, which is the basis for the transactions in the state module, and which makes the undo history and collaborative editing possible.

In addition, there are modules for basic editing commands, binding keys, undo history, input macros, collaborative editing, a simple document schema, and more under the GitHub prosemirror organization.

The fact that ProseMirror isn't distributed as a single, browser-loadable script means that you'll probably want to use some kind of bundler when using it. A bundler is a tool that automatically finds your script's dependencies, and combines them into a single big file that you can easily load from a web page. You can read more about bundling on the web, for example here.
